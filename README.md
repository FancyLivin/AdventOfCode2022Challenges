# AdventOfCodeDay2
My submission for the advent of code 2022 day 2 challenge

Day 2's challenge was to create a system that keeps track of your score in a rock paper scissors tournament.
I challenged myself to write a soluation without using any if statements for either parts.
This code is the result of that challenge.

The .txt file is my unique input.
This code should work for any other input regardless of total number of inputs.
